## Installation and Configuration

Follow these steps to install and configure Auto-Something for your development environment:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7+**: Auto-Something requires Python version 3.7 or higher.
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the Auto-Something repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henryperkins/auto-something.git
   cd auto-something
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**

   Auto-Something requires certain environment variables for configuration, particularly for API keys. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and other necessary configurations:

   ```plaintext
   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

   # Azure OpenAI Configuration
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your-deployment-name
   ```

   Replace `your-openai-api-key`, `your-azure-api-key`, `your-resource-name`, and `your-deployment-name` with your actual credentials.

2. **Configuration File**

   Customize the `config.yaml` file to adjust settings such as concurrency, logging, and model parameters. Here's an example of what you might configure:

   ```yaml
   openai:
     api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
     model: gpt-4
     max_tokens: 6000
     temperature: 0.2

   cache:
     enabled: true
     directory: .cache
     max_size_mb: 100
     ttl_hours: 24

   logging:
     level: INFO
     log_file: logs/application.log

   concurrency:
     limit: 5
     max_workers: 4
   ```

   Ensure that the `config.yaml` file is in the same directory as your main script.

### Running the Tool

Once installed and configured, you can run Auto-Something to generate documentation for a specified repository or directory:

```bash
python main.py <input_path> <output_file>
```

- `<input_path>`: Path to the GitHub repository URL or local directory.
- `<output_file>`: Path where the generated documentation will be saved.

## Troubleshooting Guide

This section provides solutions to common issues that users might encounter when installing, configuring, or running Auto-Something. If you experience a problem not covered here, please consider reaching out for support.

### Common Issues

1. **Installation Errors**

   - **Problem**: Errors during `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that your Python version is 3.7 or higher. Check that you are using a virtual environment and that it is activated. If specific packages fail to install, try updating `pip` and `setuptools` with `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools`.

2. **Environment Variable Issues**

   - **Problem**: Missing or incorrect API keys.
   - **Solution**: Verify that your `.env` file is correctly set up in the root directory. Ensure that all required environment variables are defined and have valid values.

3. **Configuration File Errors**

   - **Problem**: Errors related to `config.yaml`.
   - **Solution**: Check for syntax errors in your YAML file. Ensure that all required fields are present and correctly formatted. Use a YAML validator if necessary.

4. **Runtime Errors**

   - **Problem**: Errors when running the main script.
   - **Solution**: Review the error message for specific details. Common issues include missing dependencies, incorrect input paths, or API connection problems. Ensure that your internet connection is stable and that API services are operational.

5. **Logging Issues**

   - **Problem**: Logs are not being generated.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the logging configuration in `config.yaml` specifies a valid file path and that the directory is writable. Check for any errors in the logging setup.

### Debugging Tips

- **Check Logs**: Review the log files located in the `logs` directory for detailed error messages and stack traces. These logs can provide insights into what went wrong.

- **Verbose Output**: Increase the logging level to `DEBUG` in `config.yaml` to get more detailed output, which can help identify the source of the problem.

- **Test Environment**: Ensure that your development environment is set up correctly, with all dependencies installed and environment variables configured.

- **API Connectivity**: Verify that your API keys are correct and that you have internet access. Test connectivity to the API endpoints using tools like `curl` or `ping`.
